Welcome! This is a little log of changes in my raspberry pi meteorological station.

For questions contact me at marcialbarajas[at]gmail.com

Version 0.1

First, for this station it has the following devices running:

-> Temperature: Ds18b20 Thermometer wiring into a breadboard in the connector gpio4.

-> Pressure: Adafruit BMP085. The most cheap pressure sensor, i had installed a BME280 but it doesn't running on it. i have to check it again.
 It is wired in the gpio2 (SDA) and gpio3(SCL)

-> Humidity and Altitude: DHT11 sensor, Cheap and efficient module. it is wired into Gpio14 port.

-> Rain meter: A3-WH-SP-RG rain meter. Is a professional Rain meter with 0.2974 mm bucket capacity, it is wired in the gpio6 (pin 31)

-> Anemometer: A3-WH-SP-WS01 anemometer. Same as the Rainmeter. It has 9 cm. radius, is wired in the gpio5 (pin 29)

Version 0.2

Fixed some bugs in the script which it was doing annoying crashes. Ported Ds18b20 as a module instead a script

Version 0.3

Fixed DHT11 problems around the wire connection. Added the anemometer to the script but still not running

Version 0.4

Added MariaDB to the script, now it is running and saving records on temperature, humidity, pressure and altitude

Version 0.5

Added Rainmeter to the script. MariaDB now saves records for Rainmeter and Wind measures.

Version 0.6

Fixed minor bugs, Rainmeter was not saving data correctly.

Version 0.7

All is running! Still have to improve some code, but it works correctly.

Version 0.8

Added Telebot (pyTelegramBotAPI, from eternnoir) module for send messages every time interval, those messages send the measure of Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Wind measure and Rain measures.
